    <p>
      UAARG is a student vehicle project in the Faculty of Engineering. We
      design and build our own UAV systems, typically of similar size to radio
      controlled model airplanes. Every year a system is designed, built, tested
      and then competed internationally. We offer the opportunity for students
      to put theory into practice and gain valuable design and management
      experience.

      UAARG is composed of individual sub-teams that each work on a focused
      aspect of our drone.  Members are encouraged to join the teams they are
      most interested in, but to also explore other teams to gain
      interdisciplinary experience.
