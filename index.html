    <p>We are a group of motivated university students <b> building the future
      of autonomous aircraft.</b> Since our inception in 2004 our focus lies in 
      overcoming complex engineering challenges
       associated with fully autonomous drones.
    </p>
    <p> We design, manufacture and rigorously test our drones 
      <b>from scratch</b> while annually representing University of Alberta in
      national and international RPAS competitions.
