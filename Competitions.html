        Unmanned Systems Canada Student UAV Competition</a>, student teams are asked to fly over a search area cover a search area containing multiple regions and targets of interest, and collect information about those regions. The 2023 challenge focused
            mostly on the commercial applications of UAVs.

            <a href="http://www.auvsi-suas.org/">Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems
        International (AUVSI) Student Unmanned Systems competition</a>. It is held each June in Maryland near Lexington Park. Its objectives are to takeoff, navigate a series of GPS way points, enter a search area and land. Throughout the
            flight surveillance footage is taken and various targets and their characteristics are identified. The more of these tasks that are accomplished autonomously, the higher the score.
