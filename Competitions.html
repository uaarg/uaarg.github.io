      At the <a href="https://www.unmannedsystems.ca/home/students/student-competition-details/">
        Unmanned Systems Canada Student UAV Competition</a>, student teams are asked to fly
      over a search area cover a search area containing multiple regions and targets of interest, and collect
      information about those regions. The 2014 challenge focused mostly on the commercial applications of UAVs.

      <a href="http://www.auvsi-suas.org/">Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems
        International (AUVSI) Student Unmanned Systems competition</a>. It is held each June in Maryland near
      Lexington Park. Its objectives are to takeoff, navigate a series of GPS way points, enter a search area and
      land. Throughout the flight surveillance footage is taken and various targets and their characteristics are
      identified. The more of these tasks that are accomplished autonomously, the higher the score.
