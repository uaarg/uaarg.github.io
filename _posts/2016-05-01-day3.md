Hi All,

We performed our last competition flight. As a treat there is a video at the end showing take off and landing.

We were given 1hr to generate a report of the flight. Everyone you see below is busy generating the report. Everyone else was having enough free time to take the picture.

Shout-out to Jorge for organizing the report generation

Target areas were superimposed onto a map of the search area.

The final results will be made known to us tonight.
