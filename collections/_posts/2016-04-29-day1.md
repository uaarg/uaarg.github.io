Hi All,

Today we had our system presentation. It was esentially a faux pitch to an agricultural client. The presentation went well and the lead presentation judge mentioned in passing that he liked our presentation.

In addition we had our flight readiness review. This review is where we prove that we are able to operate our plane safely. This again went exceedingly well.

Finally we had time to do a test flight. Takeoff, flight, automatic control, imaging and landing all went off without a hitch.

Everything looks well for tommorrow's competition flight. Below is a simulated survey path for our UAV.

It's a bit late tonight, but I promise plenty of pictures tommorrow.
